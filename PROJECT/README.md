**Interactive Systems Design II
Summer Term 2022

Formalia:**
Hand in a 7 DIN A4 pages documentation of an embedded / interactive system for a
medical device. Present your models at the end of the semester in a 5 minutes.
Your documentation should include:
Models based on UML/SysML standards.

**Task:**

A concept for a medical device is required, which is able to detect and visualize
changes in vital parameters. The behaviour of the system needs to be specified on a
high level. The system architecture should be described in its behaviour with respect
to the context, use case, possible states and users (medical experts/patient).
Medical devices have specific characteristics for the hardware. Please describe the
hardware requirements and how the correct function is ensured in your design.
Also refine the user interface for your modelled behaviour with prototyping methods
you know from ISD1, with a focus to your described users/personas.
Once your high-level behaviour is modelled. You should come up with a hardware
concept for sensors and processing units.
